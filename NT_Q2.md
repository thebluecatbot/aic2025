# Statement of Purpose for the Artificial Intelligence Community at IIT Bombay  

The convergence of large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, and synthetic data generation represents a frontier in artificial intelligence that balances technical rigor with creative problem-solving. As a first-year M.Tech student in Biomdical Engineering, BSBE with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Engineering from Osmania University, my academic journey has been defined by a shift from foundational programming to advanced AI research, specifically in designing prompts and generating synthetic datasets for LLM applications. Joining the Artificial Intelligence Community (AIC) at IIT Bombay will enable me to contribute my expertise in these domains while collaborating on cutting-edge projects that redefine how AI systems learn, adapt, and innovate.  

## Academic and Technical Foundation  

My undergraduate studies in Computer Science provided a robust grounding in algorithms, data structures, and machine learning. Courses in **natural language processing (NLP)** and **deep learning** introduced me to transformer architectures and their role in modern AI systems. During this period, I developed a Python-based sentiment analysis tool using RoBERTa and SpaCy, which parsed restaurant reviews to optimize menu offerings—a project that underscored the practical value of well-crafted prompts in eliciting actionable insights from LLMs.  

Transitioning to an M.Tech in Biomedical Engineering, I retained my computational focus while exploring synthetic data generation as a solution to data scarcity in healthcare AI. This interdisciplinary perspective has equipped me to address challenges like privacy-preserving dataset creation and bias mitigation, which are critical for deploying ethical AI systems.  

## Research and Projects in Prompt Engineering and Synthetic Data  

### 1. **Prompt Optimization for Low-Resource NLP Tasks**  
In a self-directed project, I engineered prompts to improve few-shot learning performance in low-resource languages. By combining **meta-prompting** (structuring model reasoning steps) and **chain-of-thought** techniques, I achieved a 15% accuracy boost in sentiment classification for Telugu text—a language with limited annotated corpora. This work highlighted how strategic prompt design can reduce reliance on massive training datasets, a principle I aim to extend to multimodal AI systems at AIC-IITB.  

### 2. **Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline**  
Leveraging GPT-4, I built a pipeline to synthesize clinical trial reports for rare diseases, addressing data gaps that hinder drug discovery. The system used **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to ground outputs in medical literature, achieving 92% factual consistency when validated against real-world studies. This project demonstrated synthetic data’s potential to accelerate research while adhering to privacy regulations—a capability I plan to refine through AIC’s computational resources.  

### 3. **LLM Fine-Tuning for Code Generation**  
Collaborating with a startup, I fine-tuned CodeLlama-13B using synthetic Python code snippets generated through iterative **prompt engineering**. By iterating on prompts that emphasized modularity and PEP-8 compliance, the model’s code-execution success rate improved from 68% to 89% on unseen problems. This experience solidified my belief in synthetic data as a force multiplier for AI development.  

## Proposed Contributions to AIC-IITB  

### 1. **Prompt Engineering Workshops**  
I will organize workshops on advanced prompt techniques like **zero-shot task generalization** and **constitutional AI**, where participants learn to steer LLMs toward ethical, unbiased outputs. These sessions will include hands-on exercises using AIC’s GPU clusters to optimize prompts for robotics control and scientific literature summarization.  

### 2. **Synthetic Data Hackathons**  
Drawing from my experience in healthcare AI, I propose a hackathon focused on generating synthetic datasets for under-resourced domains—e.g., creating culturally diverse dialogue corpora for Indic language chatbots. Participants will use frameworks like LangChain and guidance to ensure data fidelity while avoiding real-world privacy pitfalls.  

### 3. **Open-Source Tool Development**  
I aim to lead the development of **PromptForge**, a library that automates prompt optimization via reinforcement learning. This tool will integrate with AIC’s existing MLops pipelines, enabling researchers to systematically evaluate prompts across metrics like robustness and fairness.  

## Learning Objectives and Long-Term Vision  

Through AIC-IITB, I seek to:  
1. Master **distributed training techniques** to scale synthetic data generation for trillion-token LLMs, leveraging IIT Bombay’s high-performance computing infrastructure.  
2. Pioneer **neuro-symbolic prompting frameworks** that combine LLMs with formal knowledge graphs, enhancing reasoning in domains like legal analytics and financial forecasting.  
3. Establish **synthetic data validation protocols** to quantify the realism and bias of machine-generated datasets, contributing to global standards for AI safety[.  

Long-term, I envision founding a research lab that bridges prompt engineering and synthetic data science, creating open-source tools to democratize access to high-quality training corpora. AIC’s culture of interdisciplinary collaboration will be instrumental in achieving this vision.  

## Conclusion  

My trajectory—from optimizing restaurant menus with NLP to synthesizing clinical trial data—reflects a sustained commitment to advancing AI’s capabilities through innovative prompt design and data generation. At AIC-IITB, I will contribute my technical expertise while absorbing insights from peers working on quantum machine learning, embodied AI, and other frontier domains. Together, we can redefine the boundaries of what synthetic intelligence can achieve.
