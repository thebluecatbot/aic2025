# Statement of Purpose  
# Artificial Intelligence Community, IIT Bombay  

I am a first-year M.Tech student in Biomedical Engineering, having completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Osmania University. My academic and project experiences have steered me from core programming and machine learning into the rapidly evolving domains of large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, generative AI, and synthetic data generation. Joining the AIC at IIT Bombay will allow me to deepen these interests, contribute practical skills, and collaborate on real-world AI challenges.  

## Academic Background & Technical Skills  
-  Programming Languages: C++ (foundations), now proficient in Python.  
-  Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch and standard NLP toolkits.  
-  Coursework: Data Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing.  

## Project Experience  
-  Business Analytics: Applied regression and clustering techniques to derive insights from sales datasets.  
-  Restaurant Menu Optimization: Used NLP to analyze customer reviews and recommend menu changes.  
-  Sentiment Analysis: Built a text-classification pipeline to gauge public opinion on social media.  
-  Yoga Classification: Developed a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to identify yoga poses from sensor data.  

## Current Research Focus  
I am now working on Genomic Language Models—LLMs adapted for DNA and protein sequences—to explore genotype-to-phenotype prediction tasks. This involves preprocessing genomic data, fine-tuning transformer architectures, and evaluating model outputs against biological benchmarks.  

## Interests & Contributions  
I am particularly passionate about:  
1. Prompt Engineering: Designing and optimizing prompts to improve LLM performance on specialized tasks, including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning.  
2. Generative AI & Synthetic Data: Creating high-quality synthetic datasets to address data scarcity, privacy, and class imbalance, especially in biomedical,social domains.  

At AIC-IITB, I will:  
-  Organize hands-on sessions on prompt engineering techniques—zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation.  
-  Share best practices for synthetic data pipelines, covering data quality, validation, and privacy considerations.  
-  Collaborate on peer research projects that integrate LLMs with domain data, ensuring reproducibility and open-source tooling.  

## Learning Goals & Long-Term Vision  
Through AIC’s workshops, hackathons, and mentorship, I aim to master distributed LLM training, advance synthetic data validation methods, and contribute to ethical AI guidelines. Long-term, I envision leading interdisciplinary teams to develop AI-driven solutions in healthcare and genomics, making data-driven research accessible and responsible.  

I am eager to bring my technical foundation, hands-on project experience, and enthusiasm for prompt engineering and generative AI to the Artificial Intelligence Community at IIT Bombay.
