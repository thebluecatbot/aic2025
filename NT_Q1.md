# Hackathon Preparation Timeline (1-Month Plan)

## Project Overview

A detailed 4-week (30-day) preparation plan for an AI hackathon, covering:

* **Problem selection & quantitative formulation**
* **Data sourcing & preprocessing techniques**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Model selection, training strategies, compute requirements**
* **Team roles, milestones, deliverables, risk mitigation**

---

## Week 1 (Days 1–7): Strategic Problem Selection & Quantitative Formulation

### Objectives

1. Pinpoint 3–5 high-impact challenge statements aligned with the hackathon theme
2. Define rigorous, measurable success criteria and baseline benchmarks
3. Produce a clear, version-controlled solution scoping document

### Tasks

* **Theme & Submission Analysis**

  * Review hackathon rules/themes; filter problems by low submission counts to boost odds
  * Cross-check with team expertise and novelty (avoid over-solved problems)
* **Literature & Competitive Review**

  * Survey past winning projects for similar challenges
  * Identify innovative techniques and gap areas
* **Feasibility & Scope Definition**

  * Map required data sources, compute needs, potential roadblocks
  * Draft preliminary architecture: component diagram, data flow, modular interfaces
* **Quantitative Framework**

  * Set target metrics (e.g., accuracy ≥ 85%, recall ≥ 80%, inference latency < 200 ms)
  * Establish baseline using simple models or toy datasets
  * Define success vs. partial credit thresholds

### Deliverables

* **Problem Selection Report** (PDF/Markdown) detailing shortlisted problems with submission stats, feasibility scores, and alignment rationale
* **Solution Scope & Metrics** (Git versioned) including:

  * Success-metric table
  * Baseline benchmark results
  * High-level system diagram

## Week 2 (Days 8–14): Data Strategy, Preprocessing Pipeline & EDA

### Objectives

1. Acquire and catalog required datasets (primary + backups)
2. Build a reusable, automated preprocessing pipeline
3. Conduct deep EDA to inform feature engineering

### Tasks

* **Data Acquisition Planning**

  * List data sources (APIs, public datasets, web scraping)
  * Secure access (API keys, downloads) and establish backups
* **Automated Preprocessing Workflow**

  * Missing-value handling: drop threshold or imputation
  * Outlier detection: IQR or z-score trimming
  * Normalization & Scaling:

    * Min–max for neural nets
    * Standardization for tree-based models
  * Class imbalance remedies: SMOTE or focal-loss
  * Feature engineering: FFT for time-series, one-hot for categorical, embeddings for text
  * Package steps into versioned scripts/notebooks with config files
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**

  * Univariate plots (histograms, boxplots)
  * Correlation heatmaps for multicollinearity
  * Comparative summary: raw vs. cleaned stats
  * EDA notebook with narrative insights and charts

### Deliverables

* **Preprocessing Repository** (Git) containing:

  * `data_acquisition.py` / Jupyter notebooks
  * `preprocess.py` modules with unit tests
  * Config YAML for thresholds/parameters
* **EDA Report** (Notebook + HTML) with annotated visualizations
* **Data Dictionary** summarizing raw fields, transformation logic, final schema

## Week 3 (Days 15–21): Advanced Model Development & Compute Planning

### Objectives

1. Compare candidate algorithms and architectures
2. Define resource-aware training pipelines
3. Secure and budget compute resources

### Tasks

  | Hybrid         | Graph Neural Networks | Graph data           | Captures structure, complex setup |

* **Training Workflow & Tuning**

  * Hyperparameter tuning: Optuna vs. grid search
  * Cross-validation: Stratified k‑fold (k=5)
  * Early-stopping: monitor val loss (patience=10)
  * Logging: MLflow or TensorBoard

* **Reproducibility & Packaging**

  * `Dockerfile` with env specs
  * `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`
  * CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) for lint/tests/container build

* **Compute & Cost Estimation**

  * Compare AWS EC2 P3 vs. local GPUs vs. free-tier credits
  * Draft cost projections (hours × rate)
  * Reserve credits and schedule GPU access

### Deliverables
